following up on the ROI calculation and scheduling the technical demo."
```

### Specific Coaching Example
```
Immediate Action: "Practice the acknowledge-clarify-respond-confirm technique 
for budget objections. The prospect said 'budget is tight' but you jumped 
straight to discounting instead of exploring their budget process."

Better Response: "I understand budget is a concern. Can you help me understand 
how budget decisions are typically made for initiatives like this?"
```
