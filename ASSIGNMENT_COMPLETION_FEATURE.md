# Assignment Completion Notification System

## Overview
This feature implements a comprehensive notification system that automatically detects when users complete assigned scenarios and notifies the managers who assigned them. The system provides full end-to-end tracking with UI updates across the application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Added**: `scenario_assignment_id` field to `calls` table to link completed calls to their originating assignments
- **Utilizes**: Existing `assignment_completions` table for tracking completion records
- **Utilizes**: Existing `notifications` table for manager notifications

### 2. Assignment Completion Detection
**File**: `/app/api/save-call/route.ts`
- Detects when a saved call is from an assigned scenario
- Creates completion record in `assignment_completions` table
- Updates assignment status to 'completed' with score and result
- Sends notification to the manager who created the assignment

**Notification Details**:
- **Type**: `assignment_completed`
- **Title**: "Assignment Completed: [Scenario Title]"
- **Message**: "[User Name] has completed the assigned scenario '[Scenario Title]' with a score of [X]%"
- **Payload**: Includes call_id, assignment_id, score, and result for deep linking

### 3. Assignment Context Flow
**Modified Files**:
- `/components/pages/saved-scenarios.tsx` - Added `handlePlayAssignment()` to pass assignment ID via URL
- `/components/pages/live-simulation.tsx` - Enhanced to capture and store assignment ID in temp call data
- `/components/pages/post-call-review.tsx` - Modified to pass assignment ID when saving calls

**Flow**:
1. User clicks "Start" on assignment → URL includes `assignmentId` parameter
2. Simulation page captures assignment ID and stores it in scenario data
3. When call ends, assignment ID is included in temp call data
4. Post-call review passes assignment ID to save-call API
5. Save-call API detects assignment and triggers completion workflow

### 4. Enhanced Notification Handling
**File**: `/components/ui/notifications.tsx`
- **Assignment Completion Notifications**: Click opens the specific completed call's review modal
- **Other Assignment Notifications**: Click navigates to assignments tab
- Uses `notification.payload.call_id` for direct navigation to review

### 5. UI Enhancements

#### Saved Scenarios Page
**File**: `/components/pages/saved-scenarios.tsx`
- **Completion Status**: Enhanced status badges show completion date and score
- **View Results Button**: For completed assignments, opens the specific call review
- **API Integration**: Added support for finding calls by assignment ID

#### Dashboard Assignment Cards
**File**: `/components/pages/dashboard.tsx`
- **Score Display**: Shows score percentage badge for completed assignments
- **Completion Date**: Shows "Completed [date]" instead of deadline for completed assignments
- **Visual Feedback**: Green completion status with score indicator

#### API Enhancement
**File**: `/app/api/calls/route.ts`
- **Assignment Filter**: Added `assignmentId` parameter support
- **Query Enhancement**: Enables filtering calls by specific assignment for results viewing

## User Experience Flow

### For Assigned Users:
1. **Receive Assignment**: See assignment in dashboard with "Not Started" status
2. **Start Assignment**: Click "Start" button → redirected to simulation with assignment context
3. **Complete Simulation**: Finish call and save in post-call review
4. **Automatic Completion**: Assignment automatically marked as completed with score

### For Managers:
1. **Assign Scenarios**: Create assignments for team members
2. **Get Notified**: Receive real-time notification when user completes assignment
3. **View Results**: Click notification → opens specific call review modal
4. **Track Progress**: See completion status and scores in dashboard and assignments page

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Assignment Completion Detection
- Automatic detection when assigned scenario calls are saved
- Links calls to originating assignments via `scenario_assignment_id`

### ✅ Manager Notifications
- Real-time notifications with assignment completion details
- Deep linking to specific call reviews
- Notification includes user name, scenario title, and score

### ✅ UI Status Updates
- **Dashboard**: Assignment cards show completion status and scores
- **Saved Scenarios**: Detailed completion information with "View Results" button
- **Notifications**: Smart navigation based on notification type

### ✅ Assignment Tracking
- Completion records in `assignment_completions` table

- Score and pass/fail result tracking

## Technical Highlights

### Zero Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- New features built on existing architecture
- Backward compatible with all current workflows

### RBAC Compliant
- Uses existing authentication and authorization
- Respects team boundaries and manager relationships
- All actions logged for audit trails

### Real-Time Updates
- Notifications appear immediately upon completion
- UI reflects completion status across all pages
- Deep linking for seamless navigation

### Scalable Architecture
- Supports individual and team assignments
- Handles high-volume scenarios
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

## Files Modified

### API Routes
- `/app/api/save-call/route.ts` - Assignment completion detection and notification
- `/app/api/calls/route.ts` - Assignment filtering support

### Database Schema
- `/scripts/add-assignment-tracking-to-calls.sql` - Database migration

### UI Components
- `/components/pages/saved-scenarios.tsx` - Assignment UI enhancements
- `/components/pages/live-simulation.tsx` - Assignment context capture
- `/components/pages/post-call-review.tsx` - Assignment ID passing
- `/components/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Assignment card enhancements
- `/components/ui/notifications.tsx` - Smart notification navigation

### Types
- `/lib/types.ts` - Already supported assignment completion types

## Testing Considerations

### End-to-End Flow Testing
1. Manager assigns scenario to user
2. User completes assigned scenario
3. Verify assignment marked as completed
4. Verify manager receives notification
5. Verify notification navigation works
6. Verify UI updates across all pages

### Edge Cases
- Multiple completions of same assignment
- Assignment deletion after completion
- Network failures during completion
- Manager permission changes

This implementation provides a seamless, enterprise-grade assignment completion system that enhances the existing training workflow without disrupting current functionality.
