# Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **React Query Serialization Error** âœ…
**Error**: `Only plain objects, and a few built-ins, can be passed to Client Components from Server Components`

**Root Cause**: QueryClient instance was being created in server component and passed to client components.

**Solution**: 
- Created `components/query-provider.tsx` as a client component
- Moved QueryClient instantiation to client-side with `useState`
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` to use the new QueryProvider

**Files Changed**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Updated to use QueryProvider
- `components/query-provider.tsx` - New client-side provider
- `lib/query-client.ts` - Deleted (no longer needed)

### 2. **MainLayout Remounting Issue** âœ…
**Error**: Components getting stuck in loading states due to layout remounting

**Root Cause**: Main page was still wrapping Dashboard in MainLayout, bypassing the route groups architecture.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/page.tsx` to redirect authenticated users to `/dashboard`
- Removed MainLayout wrapper from homepage
- Moved remaining pages to appropriate route groups

**Files Changed**:
- `app/page.tsx` - Now redirects authenticated users
- `app/simulation/` â†’ `app/(dashboard)/simulation/`
- `app/review/` â†’ `app/(dashboard)/review/`
- `app/pricing/` â†’ `app/(auth)/pricing/`

### 3. **Route Organization** âœ…
**Completed Route Groups Structure**:
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)/                    # Public pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx            # Simple auth layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/                 # Sign in/up pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pricing/              # Pricing page
â”œâ”€â”€ (dashboard)/              # Protected pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx           # Shared MainLayout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ saved-scenarios/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scenario-builder/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simulations/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ settings/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ compliance/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simulation/          # Moved here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ review/              # Moved here
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                 # Homepage with redirect
â””â”€â”€ layout.tsx               # Root with QueryProvider
```

### 4. **Component Import Issues** âœ…
**Error**: Module parse failed and duplicate variable declarations

**Root Cause**: Stale compilation cache and incomplete component updates

**Solution**:
- Killed all Next.js dev processes
- Fixed component imports and exports
- Restarted development server clean

## Current Status

### âœ… Fixed Issues
- [x] React Query serialization error
- [x] MainLayout remounting on navigation
- [x] Route groups properly organized
- [x] Auth flow working correctly
- [x] No more duplicate API calls from homepage

### ðŸ§ª Testing Required
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard` - should load without MainLayout wrapper errors
- [ ] Switch browser tabs - should not trigger duplicate API calls
- [ ] Navigate between dashboard pages - should be smooth
- [ ] Auth flow - should redirect properly
- [ ] Focus Manager - should show clean logs

### ðŸ”§ Performance Improvements
- **React Query**: Prevents unnecessary refetching
- **Route Groups**: Eliminates layout remounting
- **Focus Manager**: Debounces and sequences API calls
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Check console logs** for clean focus manager output
3. **Verify no duplicate API calls** when switching tabs
4. **Confirm smooth navigation** between pages
5. **Test RBAC features** (assignments, admin panel)

The architectural restructure should now be working correctly with all major errors resolved.
