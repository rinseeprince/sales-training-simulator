# RBAC Admin Access Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
You were correctly authenticated as an admin user in the backend (as shown in the logs with `userRole: 'admin'` and `isAdmin: true`), but the frontend wasn't reflecting these admin privileges. You couldn't see the Admin Panel, had simulation limits showing, and couldn't assign scenarios to users.

## Root Causes Found

1. **Scenario Builder Issue**: The `fetchUserRole` function in `components/pages/scenario-builder.tsx` was hardcoding the user role to 'user' instead of using the actual role from the auth context.

2. **Simulation Limits**: The `/api/check-simulation-limit` endpoint wasn't checking for admin/manager roles to provide unlimited simulations.

3. **Database Role**: Your user record in the database might not have the 'admin' role set correctly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Scenario Builder Role Detection
**File**: `components/pages/scenario-builder.tsx`
- Changed from hardcoded `setUserRole('user')` to `setUserRole(user.role || 'user')`
- Now properly reads the role from the authenticated user object

### 2. Added Admin/Manager Unlimited Simulations
**File**: `app/api/check-simulation-limit/route.ts`
- Added check for admin/manager roles before checking database limits
- Admin/manager users now get:
  - `limit: -1` (unlimited)
  - `remaining: -1` (unlimited)
  - `is_paid: true` (hides the limit card in dashboard)

### 3. Enhanced Logging
**Files**: 
- `components/supabase-auth-provider.tsx` - Added detailed user logging
- `lib/supabase-auth.ts` - Added role logging in getCurrentUser

## Action Required

### 1. Update Your Database Role
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Update your user role to admin
UPDATE simple_users
SET 
  role = 'admin',
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'samuel.k@taboola.com';

-- Verify the update
SELECT id, email, role FROM simple_users 
WHERE email = 'samuel.k@taboola.com';
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache and Restart
1. Clear your browser's localStorage and sessionStorage
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. The application should now recognize you as an admin

## Expected Admin Features

Once properly configured as an admin, you should have:

1. **Navigation Access**:
   - Admin Panel (at `/admin`)
   - Compliance Settings (at `/compliance`)

2. **Unlimited Simulations**:
   - No simulation limit card shown on dashboard
   - Can run unlimited simulations

3. **Scenario Assignment**:
   - "Assign Scenario" option in Scenario Builder
   - Can search and assign scenarios to users in your domain

4. **User Management**:
   - Access to user leaderboards
   - Can view and manage team performance

## Verification Steps

1. Check browser console for logs showing:
   - `AUTH PROVIDER: User details: { role: 'admin' ... }`
   - `getCurrentUser - Role: admin`

2. Check navigation sidebar - you should see:
   - Admin Panel
   - Compliance (admin only)

3. In Scenario Builder, the "Assign Scenario" toggle should be visible

4. Dashboard should NOT show the "Free Plan Usage" card

## Technical Architecture Notes

The application uses a unified ID system where:
- `simple_users.id = auth.users.id`
- Role-based access is controlled at multiple levels:
  - Frontend: Navigation filtering, component access
  - Backend: RBAC middleware checks
  - Database: Row-level security policies

This ensures consistent role enforcement across the entire application stack.
