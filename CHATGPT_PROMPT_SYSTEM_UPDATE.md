# ChatGPT-Style Prompt System Implementation

## Overview
Your AI prospect system has been transformed to work exactly like ChatGPT, where the **scenario prompt box is the primary system prompt** and the parameters (difficulty, seniority, call type) act as behavioral modifiers.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Primary Prompt System ✅
- **Scenario prompt box content** is now the main system prompt (just like ChatGPT)
- Users can write any kind of prompt and the AI will follow it naturally
- Removed complex, structured prompt templates that created robotic responses

### 2. Behavioral Modifiers ✅
- **Difficulty (1-5)**: Controls how cooperative/challenging the prospect is
- **Seniority**: Adjusts behavioral patterns (junior vs C-level decision-making style)
- **Call Type**: Provides context (inbound vs outbound, referral, follow-up)

### 3. Natural Conversation Flow ✅
- Increased token limit from 60 to 300 for natural responses
- Removed artificial restrictions on AI asking clarifying questions
- Removed sentence counting and forced brevity
- Improved temperature and penalty settings for more human-like responses

### 4. Simplified Architecture ✅
- Updated `/api/stream-gpt-voice/route.ts` to prioritize user prompts
- Created clean helper functions for behavioral modifiers
- Updated frontend to pass parameters correctly

## How It Works Now

### Scenario Prompt Examples
Users can now write prompts like:

```
You're a marketing director at Nike, skeptical about new ad platforms because you've been burned by overpromising vendors before. You care most about proven ROI and measurable results.
```

```
Play a friendly startup founder who's interested in sales tools but has a limited budget and needs to move fast. You're technical but appreciate simple explanations.
```

```
You're a busy CFO at a Fortune 500 company who doesn't have time for long sales calls. You want to see numbers and business impact immediately or you'll end the call.
```

### Parameter Effects
- **Difficulty 1**: Very cooperative, shares info freely
- **Difficulty 3**: Moderately cooperative, realistic concerns
- **Difficulty 5**: Very guarded, requires significant effort

- **Seniority "junior"**: Focuses on day-to-day needs, needs manager approval
- **Seniority "c-level"**: Strategic thinking, limited time, business transformation focus

- **Call Type "outbound"**: Unexpected call, needs quick value demonstration
- **Call Type "inbound"**: Expressed interest, more receptive

## Technical Implementation

### API Changes
- `scenarioPrompt` becomes the primary system prompt
- Parameters become behavioral modifiers appended to the prompt
- Natural conversation flow with appropriate token limits

### Frontend Changes
- Scenario prompt passed directly without modification
- Parameters properly structured for the API
- Using the updated streaming endpoint

## Testing the System

Try these example prompts to verify natural behavior:

1. **Simple scenario**: "You're a marketing manager looking for email tools"
2. **Detailed scenario**: "You run marketing at a 500-person SaaS company. You're frustrated with your current email platform because it's expensive and the deliverability is poor. You're evaluating alternatives but worried about migration complexity."
3. **Character-driven**: "You're a skeptical IT director who's been burned by software vendors before. You ask tough technical questions and demand proof."

Each should work naturally with the AI following the prompt while the parameters adjust how cooperative/challenging they are.

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ Users can write any kind of prompt (like ChatGPT)
- ✅ AI follows instructions naturally
- ✅ Parameters fine-tune difficulty without overriding the prompt
- ✅ No more robotic, template-driven responses
- ✅ Natural conversation flow
- ✅ Maximum flexibility for scenario creation

The system now works exactly like ChatGPT - the prompt box defines the character and scenario, while the parameters adjust how that character behaves in terms of difficulty and cooperation level.
